            <h2>Police Raid Factory in Rotten Cheese Probe!!!!!</h2>
            <p> Police said on Saturday they had raided a cheese factory in southern Germany that they suspected may have been involved in selling out-of-date cheese linked to a case being investigated in Italy. Italian media reported on Friday that financial police in the northern city of Cremona had uncovered large amounts of rotting cheese which was being mixed with fresh cheese and sold onto the market in Italy and Europe.

            <p>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know yet if it really is a food scandal,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe still need to verify this.‚Äù

                Police took food samples from the Woringen factory for laboratory testing, the results of which would be known in the middle of next week. They also took documents, Owsinski said, adding that the general manager was an Italian citizen.
                
                ‚ÄúAs to whether or not the company is involved in a network, we can‚Äôt say for sure at the moment but we are continuing our investigations,‚Äù Owsinski said.

               <h3>The Case of the Cheese Bandits</h3>
               <p>In 1928, the infamous ‚ÄúCheese Bandits‚Äù were busted in Brooklyn after confessing to 25 robberies in a two-month period. They earned this title not because they stole cheese, but because they frequently ate cheese while robbing delis. For all their thieving and cheese eating, the three Cheese Bandits were eventually caught with a bail set at $100,000. In today‚Äôs dollars, that amounts to $1.5 million. That‚Äôs some valuable charcuterie.
               <p>After filming, the slippers were stored among the studio's extensive collection of costumes and faded from attention.
                     They were found in the basement of MGM's wardrobe department during preparations for a mammoth auction in 1970. One
                     pair was the highlight of the auction, going for a then unheard of $15,000 to an anonymous buyer, who apparently donated
                     them to the Smithsonian Institution in 1979. Four other pairs are known to exist; one sold for $666,000 at auction
                     in 2000. A pair was stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota and remains missing.[101]
               </p>
               <p>Another, differently styled pair not used in the film was sold at auction with the rest of her collections by owner actress Debbie Reynolds for $510,000 (not including the buyer's premium) in June 2011.[102]
